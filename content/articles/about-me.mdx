Hi, I'm **Brian Duan**, also use other username including `iceice666`, `justaslime`.
Im a student at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan.

My own bio sums it up pretty well: *"Making projects when I need. A lazy guy."* 
I build things when I have a real reason to — not for the sake of it. 
This blog exists because I needed somewhere to put my thoughts.

## What I Work With

I bounce between languages depending on what the problem calls for. 
Lately it's been a lot of **Rust** and **Zig** for systems stuff, **Haskell** and **ReScript** 
when I want to think in a more functional way, and **TypeScript** for anything web-related (including the platform this blog runs on).

## Outside of Code

I'm interested in functional programming paradigms, Linux tooling, Neovim, and occasionally game development. 
I also have a soft spot for Minecraft modding.

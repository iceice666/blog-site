Hi, I'm **Brian Duan**. You might also find me as `iceice666` or `justaslime`.
I'm a student at 🇹🇼 National Cheng Kung University.

My motto is pretty straightforward: 
"A lazy guy, only build project when I need." 
I build things when there's a reason, not to show off.
This blog is mostly a place to stash thoughts (and occasionally drop a spicy take).

## Tech Stack

I like using the right tool for the job:
- **Rust/Zig** for systems-level work
- **Python/Lua** for scripting (I try not to make Bash do anything heroic)
- **TypeScript/ReScript** for anything web-related (including this blog)

## Things I've Built

My projects have a habit of slipping… but I'm always tinkering with something.
